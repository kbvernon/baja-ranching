## From Editor

MAJOR REVISION 1. Land Security in the discussion sounds weak in the current
description without references compared with the other sections. The authors
believe the importance of land security to the rancher settlement, but the data
of this time didn't support the assumption. So the authors warned we need to be
careful. That is ok, but need to add some references which revealed the
importance of the land security.

MINOR REVISION 1. The current table numbers of table 2 and table 3 should be
swapped to align with the order of appearance of the text in the body. Or these
two tables can be merged.

## Reviewer #2

Dear authors

I have thoroughly reviewed the latest version of your manuscript, where you have
adeptly incorporated the suggestions provided earlier and addressed the
limitations of the methodology utilized. I have only two minor suggestions:

1.  I insist in replacing "co-vary" by "is correlated".

2.  Please put numbers in your equations.
